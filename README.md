# Story List

This project uses Gemini AI directly in the browser to create personalized TODO lists for children complete with a story and images.

## How it works
A simple checklist is created then fed to Google Gemini APIs directly from the browser.
The generated content is then stored in IndexedDB on the device.

- Story generation uses Gemini 2.5 Flash so a free tier key can be used.
- Image generation uses Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview so you'll need a paid key.
